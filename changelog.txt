In English, this version
- fixed bug where rotating device or switching apps restarted game from beginning
- improves the way the speech works internally
- provides support for some older phones
Technically, what I did was
- tweaked some remember's to rememberSavable.  Some values must survive device state change
- replaced TTSOK variable with function that queries TTS Engine directly at runtime
- reduce minSDK to 26, targetSDK = 30
- retrofitted or forked code that depended on newer SDK

[10003, 01.00.03, 2024-01-06]
- Tweaked colors and turning Amount "off" on Amounts screen
- shut voice up immediately on switch flip

[10002, 01.00.02, 2024-01-02]
- Textboxes have color set (to conform to Theme) (that's what Surface is for!!)
- Replace Voice On/Off Button with a Switch and made Icons represent current (not desired) Voice state
- Version number included in HowToPlay and in Feedback
